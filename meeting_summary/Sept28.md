# Meeting Summary + Post Meeting - September 28, 2024

## Meeting Summary
1. icebreaker (introduction) 
2. Expectation: We will have a similar ui of desmos where on the left we will allow the user to input the matrix transformation and on the right, we will have a display with the animation of the inputted linear transformation being applied on a square.
3. Purpose: my teacher struggles to find a visual way to explain linear transformations geometrically, the purpose of this project is to help the teacher better teach this concept and help the student understand linear transformation better
